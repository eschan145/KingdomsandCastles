# Armies
An advanced battlefield simulator.

In this game, you command an army of soldiers. They can be of the following types:

1. Light infantry         — Regular ordinary foot soldiers
2. Heavy infantry         — Heavily armored but slower foot soldiers
3. Archers                — Soldier specialized in use with a bow

Your job is to battle an enemy army with several commands. Your army is split up into multiple units; each one you can command at your will. You can assign commands to inidividual units. Units can contain smaller units with them, culminating into one huge army.

A soldier is armed with a sword and a bow. Their damage is based on their strength and range. For example, an arrow would inflict more damage at close range than far range. They start out with twenty-four arrows (fifty for archers) and their health is set to 100.
