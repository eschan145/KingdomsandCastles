When contributing, create a new post in the discussions tab. Do NOT start with a pull request unless you are absolutely sure you should. As always, use correct formatting and spelling.

Like issues, pull requests or commits should detail all of the information, but not be too lengthy. Include images if needed and diagrams. Review our Code of Conduct for rules and policies in contributing.
